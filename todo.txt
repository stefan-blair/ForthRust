
implementation:
    
    add threads
    handle page faults, so that if memory access to beyond self->end() may just map more memory in.          

    track lengths of functions in cells
    traits can have const values.  can use this to hardcode settings in a forth machine, for example, the ideal inline length

debugger: 
    
    make some errors recoverable (maybe separate kernel)
    implement a replay debugger by tracking 
    remove all of the unwraps from Debugger
    Make the debugger into an optional feature
    Check if starts with H and then add the format in

    make usize push / pop / read / write able
    make `to` set the locals / variables to push values instead of numbers

notable absent words:

    EXIT: basically ret
    COMPILE,: seems to pop an execution token off of the stack and literally compile it into the current definition.  so, if its just a DefinedOperation, it just puts the execution token.  but if its something like `+`, it literally compiles the code into it
