
implementation:
    
    do hash map instead of binary tree in the memory map.  hashing ranges could maybe be:
        start           - end => 
        0x7fabcdef1000  - 0x7fabcdef2000 =>
        left shift off the different bits of the range =>
        thats bad tho cause some out of range addresses would still map there, maybe figure out some solution
    add threads
    handle page faults, so that if memory access to beyond self->end() may just map more memory in.          

    track lengths of functions in cells
    traits can have const values.  can use this to hardcode settings in a forth machine, for example, the ideal inline length

debugger: 
    
    make some errors recoverable (maybe separate kernel)
    implement a replay debugger by tracking 
    remove all of the unwraps from Debugger
    Make the debugger into an optional feature
    Check if starts with H and then add the format in


notable absent words:

    EVALUATE: literally evaluate a string on the stack
    COMPILE,: seems to pop an execution token off of the stack and literally compile it into the current definition.  so, if its just a DefinedOperation, it just puts the execution token.  but if its something like `+`, it literally compiles the code into it
    STATE:    returns address of state, which contains a 1 if in compilation state, and 0 if in interpret state
