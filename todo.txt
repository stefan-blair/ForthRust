
implementation:

    memory -> heap, make addresses / reading / writing happen in ForthState
        add multiple memory segments, heap thing, string storage
    
    track lengths of functions in cells
    traits can have const values.  can use this to hardcode settings in a forth machine, for example, the ideal inline length

debugger: 
    
    make some errors recoverable (maybe separate kernel)
    implement a replay debugger by tracking 
    remove all of the unwraps from Debugger
    Make the debugger into an optional feature
    Check if starts with H and then add the format in


noteable abscent words:

    EVALUATE: literally evaluate a string on the stack
    COMPILE,: seems to pop an execution token off of the stack and literally compile it into the current definition.  so, if its just a DefinedOperation, it just pusts the execution token.  but if its something like `+`, it literally compiles the code into it
    STATE:    returns address of state, which contains a 1 if in compilation state, and 0 if in interpret state
