make each Kernel's `new` take in the state itself, so that DebugKernel can add the debug instruction to it
figure out some way to get configuration parameters into the kernels
make the kernels have an additional, optional message to attempt to handle errors

measure performance differences between kernel as function pointer vector and as templates
make the DefaultKernel thing not necessary to specify

Make the debugger into an optional feature
Check if starts with H and then add the format in
Make the debugger able to set breakpoints and step

the DOES command might break... because it does execute().and_then(execute), but now execute only does one instruction at a time!
